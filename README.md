# DaRKMaps
Welcome to DaRKMaps, a student-friendly GIS displaying important information for various cities across the globe. Built with C++, DaRKMaps utilizes GTK to render our maps and retrieves data from APIs such as the OpenStreetMap Database API for a smooth user experience. 

As this was made as part of UofT's ECE297 course, source code is unavailable to the public. Please contact me or open an issue if you wish to access the code.

# Features
* Choose and load a map from locations across the world
* Zoom in, zoom out, zoom fit, and move around in order to explore the map
* Choose what to display! Show streets, points of interest, intersections, subways, road closures, and more
* See more information about a certain point of interest or intersection by clicking on it
* Use the search bar to quickly highlight certain streets, intersections, or points of interest
* Choose two intersections to calculate and display the quickest path between them, including time at intersections
* Display informative directions when navigating between these optimal routes
* As the name suggests, you can choose dark mode for viewing pleasure
* Click on our help box to navigate to our help site
